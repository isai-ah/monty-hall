# Late Night Conversations

I discussed the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) with a friend late one night.  It was challenging wrapping my head around it. I decided to programmatically verify its results here.

To run the file locally, assuming you have any version of Python installed, do:
```
python montyhall.py
```
